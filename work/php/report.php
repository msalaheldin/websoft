<h2>S02</h2>
<p>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?
    <br>- Not with HTML or JavaScript. However, I have previously worked with css on previous courses.
</p>
    <p>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.
    <br>- HTML is short for Hypertext Markup language, it is a programming language that is used to describe the strucutre of information on the web.
    CSS short for Cascading Style Sheets, which is responsible for the the style and appearance of the web page.
     Whereas javascript is used to program the various functionalities on the web page. All together HTML, CSS and javascript make up the essential building blocks of the web pages.

    <p>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.
    <br>- The browser communications with web servers throught HTTP protocols. The browser sends a HTTP request to the server targeting a specific resources on the server,
    the server will then handle the request and sends a response to the browser with the targeted resource.

<p>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?
    <br>- Nope, this is the first time.

</p>
<p>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?
    <br>- Not really, I could tell it has some similarites with C#, but anyway,
     I've not really worked much with C# either.

</p>
<p>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?
<br>- I've watched a few tutorials to understand some main concepts and techniques, it took me quite a lot of time to learn but it was worth it in the end.
I am aiming for grade 4, I've not really done the flags, but i've managed to do what is required for grade 5.

<h2>S04</h2>
<p>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.
    <br>- This is absolutely my first experience using node/npm to establish a server side, I have previously worked with sockets and restful api on java. However, I find node/npm are quite different and at the same time interesting. 
    Looking forward to learn more.

</p>

<p>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?
    <br>- Quite different from anything I've previously worked with, but so far so good. I find it interesting to work with specially the routing, middleware and moudles.

</p>

<p>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?
    <br>- I've watched the lecture videos, and watched a few tutorials on youtube, then I started with the exervises, which were pretty helpful.
    Then i started right away with the assignment. So my plan was to study and have a better understanding first and then try to solve, and that pretty much worked.
    
</p>

<p> What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?
    <br>- For this assignment i aimed for grade 3. 
    The topic was pretty new and it required a bit of time to understand to concept
</p>


<p>What is your TIL for this course section?

<h2>S05</h2>
<p>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?
    <br>- Interesting, a bit difficult, as it is my first time.
</p>

<p>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?
    <br>- A bit hard to compare as it is not orbject oriented at all, 
    and the languages that I've previously used are object oriented.
</p>

<p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?
    <br>- It was a bit challenging at first. However, some practice and following the lecture videos provided sufficient knowledge to solve the tasks. I am aiming for grade 5.
</p>

<p>What is your TIL for this course section?
    <br>- My TIL for this section, is programming in PHP as well as establishing database connection in PHP and doing the CRUD functions.

<h2>S06</h2>
<p>Here is the text for this section.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S07</h2>
<p>Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.

    <br>- ASP.NET is a web application framework developed and marketed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites.
</p>

<p>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.
    <br>- .Net is quite different from the other technologies we been introduced to in the scope of this course so far, and it is quite large, requires a lot of studying as well as following up on the documentations, as some new updates might remove some features. 
</p>

<p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?
    <br>- the console part of the exercise was not hard as we have done similar exercise in Java, which is not at all different from c# considering both are object oriented. However, the web app part, that was quite challenging as it required some knowledge and futher understanding of the .net technology. following the tutorials, has of course made it easier to understand that task, and provided further understanding to how to solve it. I aimed for grade 5.
</p>

<p>What is your TIL for this course section?
    <br>- My TIL for this part, is definitely being introduced to the .net framework and the ability to build a web app from scratch using asp and razor pages.
